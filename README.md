# Hi, I'm Shahzaib Jamali 👋

I'm a dedicated University of Chicago MSCAPP student passionate about harnessing data analytics to drive transformative public policy and promote human development economics. With a robust academic foundation and hands-on experience in policy research and quantitative analysis, I strive to convert complex datasets into actionable insights that inform equitable policy decisions. My education at UChicago has equipped me with computational tools and analytical frameworks, enabling me to bridge the gap between rigorous data science and impactful public policy.

## 🔭 Current Work & Projects
At UChicago, I'm deeply involved in projects that merge advanced machine learning, data visualization, and geospatial analysis to tackle pressing societal challenges. I work on developing interactive dashboards, real-time monitoring systems, and predictive models that illuminate the economic and social dimensions of public policy. My projects often focus on the intersection of human development economics and public policy, where I analyze socio-economic data to support initiatives that improve community resilience and sustainable development.

## 🌱 Skills & Tools
- **Programming:** Python, R, SQL, Stata  
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, R Studio, Excel Automation  
- **Data Analysis:** Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Geospatial Mapping  
- **Other:** Policy Analysis, Financial Research, Project Management  

## 🌐 Interests & Aspirations
My passion lies in working at the nexus of data analytics and public policy to drive meaningful change. I am eager to collaborate on projects that address inequities, foster sustainable development, and leverage data for the public good. I believe that integrating robust data-driven insights with effective policy can pave the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.

# Epidemic Simulator: SIR Dynamics

This project implements a Python-based simulation of epidemic spread using the classic SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model. In this simulation, individuals are arranged in a ring structure where each person interacts with two neighbors, and state transitions model the spread of infection, recovery, and the loss of immunity. Configurable parameters—including contagious duration, immunity period, and infection probability—enable exploration of various epidemic scenarios, even incorporating a vaccinated state with reduced infection risk. This simulation provides a dynamic, algorithm-driven insight into the complex interplay between biological and social factors in disease transmission.
